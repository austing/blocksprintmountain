# Mountain of Money prototype

Coded at the Blockfest hackathon in Paris, in June 2016 (won "prix technique").

A toy for now -- basic functionality was there for the hackathon demo, but it needs more reflection on design and certainly still has possible exploits.

Very simple frontend and two very simple contracts. Uses [Truffle](https://github.com/ConsenSys/truffle).

```
$ truffle compile
$ truffle deploy
$ truffle serve
```
